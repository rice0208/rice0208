### Where am I?

I am in Shanghai, China, as a student in Lansheng Fudan Middle School, at 8 Shijie Rd.

### When am I available?

Well, I am going to graduate from junior high next year, so I may not have much time (for I have to prepare for High School Entrance Exam). I will have much time in June 2022.

### More information?

Here's our school's (not so good!) website: [https://lansheng.fdfz.cn/index.aspx](https://lansheng.fdfz.cn/index.aspx)
And also, I have some more accounts (on code websites), which is also rice0208. Search for rice0208, if there is one, that may be me.
